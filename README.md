## About

This repo is a collection of problems I snagged from Leetcode to interview prep.
The workspace is a Rust workspace with each solution being a crate.

to create a new problem, new_problem.sh is provided - usage:
`new_problem.sh <name_of_problem`
This will create the crate structure for the new problem as well as add it to the workspace
